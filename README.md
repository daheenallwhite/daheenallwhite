Hello, I am Daheen Lee, an iOS developer with over four years of industry experience. In my current role, I have successfully navigated through all stages of app development, from conception to deployment. I had the honor of presenting at [ifKakao 2020](https://elseif.kakao.com/2020/session/80), one of South Korea's premier developer conferences. There, I shared insights through adopting RIBs architecture into an iOS app, an initiative that has significantly enhanced our project outcomes. 

My goal is to contribute to a company whose services not only excite me as a user but also inspire me as a developer. I am passionate about applying my skills to enhance and grow services I deeply value.
